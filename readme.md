# Chatroom project

## The project Idea

This was a mini project I made in college for Operating systems subject, using this app we can have a chat room between two people at the same device by running the server script while also running two client scripts.

What I learned:
- practiced some theoratical networking concepts such as **sockets**, **ip address and ports, tcp**. I also practiced operating concepts like multithreading
- improvement in python

## Programming Language

Python was selected as the programming language for this project primarily for the purpose of practicing and familiarizing myself with it as a new language. There was no specific technical reason behind this choice.
